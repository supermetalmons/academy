# 3 White Openings to Get Started

## Opening #1: The Atlantean

![Opening 1](/img/ultrametal/opening1.png)

This is a very common type of opening in the early meta. It develops your key scoring mons nicely and sets up a variety of plays moving forward. A Drainer/Angel pair is a very strong tool, as a protected Drainer can safely hold a position without fearing an immediate knockout by an enemy mon. You can always simply book it if your Angel is fainted. Staying in the center file with this pair keeps them maximally far away from both bombs. Interestingly, G3 is also safe for the Drainer and may be played as well, but E3 is not — the opponent’s Spirit can pull the bomb closer before picking it up in order to target that square on turn 1.

The strength of your own Spirit’s positioning is that it targets two close mana simultaneously while also advancing toward the right-side item. In some circumstances (as shown above), it can also set up a very early Super Mana grab — provided your opponent doesn’t move close enough toward either bomb on their first turn to target you afterwards. Additionally, it does give you the option to boost your Mystic out of its spawn, but this likely offers only very situational benefits.

Note: 4/5 of your mana are 4 tiles away from a mana pool at game start, and one is 5 tiles away. If you want to dunk a close mana with only your Spirit and mana moves, it takes (optimally) two turns, but a third is required to score your far mana. The outer mana are faster to go for — especially if you plan on picking up any two-pointers, which can negate the need to ever pick up that slower inner mana at all.

## Opening #2: Boost Fork

The Fork opening is strong because it advances toward both items, and by developing your attackers you threaten the overwhelming majority of the board. Any move forward by any of your opponent’s pieces could put them within either your Demon or Mystic’s attack range. You are guaranteed to pick up at least one item on your next turn. If your opponent wants one, they may be forced to burn their first turn running to pick it up; if they don’t, you can Spirit-boost your Mystic to pick up both on turn 2. Thanks to the potential for quick, assured item grabs and many immediate attacks, this opening can fit an aggressive playstyle.

## Opening #3: Potion Rush

If you can’t wait for turn 2 to pick up an item, simply grab one on turn 1. Any mon can rush to the item space immediately, but it will cost all five of your movements. Advancing this far puts that mon at risk from the enemy Mystic, so picking up the bomb at this point would be futile; however, if your opponent chooses to use three moves and an ability point to faint your mon, you still have that potion and now they only have two movements and a mana move to develop their plans. One of your mons fainting is not the end of the world, especially in the early game or if you were planning to move other pieces next turn regardless. You can pick up the right-side item too, but this is slightly weaker — if your opponent then attacks with their Demon, they are developed two tiles further toward your territory, making them a bigger threat than a further-back Mystic. An early potion can be a valuable tool; it may seem simplistic, but holding that resource from the start can provide the threat level and flexibility you need to succeed.

This concludes our brief introduction to openings for White.
