# 3 Strong Techniques to Look Out For

## Spirit Dunking

Aside from the Drainer, Spirits are the only mon type capable of moving a mana piece. You can use this to score your own mana, but another option is Spirit-moving your opponent’s mana into their pool. If a player moves one of their mana adjacent to a pool (planning to nudge it in next turn), check if you can get your Spirit into position to dunk it first. This not only prevents the 1 point they would have received, but earns 2 points for you.

This works the same for a mana on its own or a Drainer holding a mana. If you are the one to push that Drainer into the pool, you receive the points — even while it’s in their hands. Smart positioning to simply threaten a Spirit Dunk can slow an opponent’s mana collection. Being unable to move mana adjacent to the pool means they can’t score using only a mana move and must rely on Spirit or Drainer play, burning resources.

This technique becomes much stronger if you’re holding a potion. Then your opponent can’t safely move mana to within 2 tiles of a pool. With both potions, a triple Spirit move can be incredibly scary. A mon can move 5 tiles and the Spirit ability targets any space 2 tiles away — a Spirit near the middle can sometimes threaten all four pools at once.

## Mana Shielding & Body Blocking

It’s often difficult to advance without entering the effective range of an enemy Demon or Mystic. Active abilities target from 2 tiles away; with all 5 movements used on a single mon, the effective range is 7 tiles in any direction. Since the board is only 11 wide, if an attacking mon isn’t almost all the way on the opposite side, you may be vulnerable.

In these cases you might preemptively faint their mon, continue with other pieces, or set up a bait. You can also position your other pieces — both mons and mana — to protect a piece you plan to use soon. Depending on the board state, you can do this in three ways: path denial, target denial, and caging (pictured above).

- Path denial (walls): ensure there are no diagonal gaps and that the wall is wider than the distance to the mon you want to protect; otherwise movement is redirected but not slowed.
- Target denial: occupy the key space(s) an enemy mon must occupy to target you. Watch out for potions that enable a Spirit to (re)move your blocker.
- Caging: in the pools it’s sometimes possible to fully surround an enemy mon to prevent movement.

All of these methods can use any mon type as well as mana pieces. Mons can be fainted by enemy attackers, but mana cannot block a Drainer. Stay aware of where threats may come from and how to move safely — even if it means holding back or moving a mana away from your own pools.

## Midline Hold

The SMM board is 11x11; unlike chess, there’s a middle row, column, and space. From any space on either midline you are exactly 5 tiles away from 2 mana pools. A Drainer with mana in hand on a midline space is very powerful — it can be hard for your opponent to block both pools.

The central Super Mana is 5 tiles from all 4 pools but may be weaker because paths are more restrictive. From C6, for example, there are numerous paths to dunk regardless of clutter, but from the exact center there’s only one path to each pool, which can be blocked by single pieces.

Depending on positioning, you can also sit on the midline without mana and threaten to grab one en route to a pool. This is especially effective if your opponent is slowly walking a mana while their Drainer is elsewhere. You may even threaten two different mana, making it near impossible to prevent you getting either. The very middle can be dangerous and obvious; consider leaving your Drainer one space back from the midline with a Spirit ready to boost them across as a sneaky alternative.

This concludes our brief introduction to techniques you may want to use — and be on guard against.
